# Executive Brief: AI Policy Modernization
**To:** CEO Leadership Team  
**From:** Joshua Peskay, vCISO  
**Date:** August 25, 2025  
**Re:** AI Governance Policy Update & Risk Mitigation

## Executive Summary
We recommend updating CEO's AI policy to enable broader, safer AI adoption while maintaining security controls. This addresses our #2 organizational risk (Insufficient AI Governance, 20.8 residual risk score) and positions CEO for improved operational efficiency.

## Current State Challenges

### Limited Coverage & Opportunity for Growth
- **Limited Coverage:** Only ~70 staff (10%) have sanctioned AI access via ChatGPT Enterprise
- **Organic Demand:** Industry data suggests 80%+ of nonprofit staff are interested in AI tools for productivity
- **Security Opportunity:** Unmanaged AI usage creates opportunities to improve our data governance

### Policy & Cost Optimization
- **Policy Evolution:** Current policy was appropriately cautious but can be refined based on experience
- **Cost Opportunity:** Paying for ChatGPT Enterprise while having included Gemini licenses available
- **Implementation Growth:** Policy exists with room for enhanced training, monitoring, and support

## Proposed Solution: "Channel the Water"

Rather than attempting to prevent AI use entirely, we recommend providing a secure, sanctioned path that meets staff productivity needs while maintaining appropriate controls.

### Strategic Approach
- **Enable vs. Restrict:** Provide approved tools rather than blanket prohibitions
- **Training-First:** Mandatory education before access
- **Monitoring & Support:** Visibility into usage with help resources
- **Graduated Access:** Start with core tools, expand based on needs

## Business Benefits

### Risk Reduction
- **Managed Usage:** Move from uncontrolled external AI use to managed, monitored usage within our security perimeter
- **Enhanced Data Protection:** Utilize Google Workspace security controls for AI processing of organizational data
- **Incident Response:** Established procedures for AI-related issues
- **Compliance:** Auditable usage patterns and policy adherence

### Operational Efficiency  
- **Cost Optimization:** Utilize existing Google Workspace AI capabilities vs. additional licensing
- **Productivity Gains:** Expand AI access from 70 to 700+ staff with proper training
- **Competitive Advantage:** Enable staff efficiency improvements while peers struggle with governance
- **Skill Development:** Build organizational AI capabilities systematically

## Security & Compliance Framework

### Technical Controls
- **Training-Gated Access:** Mandatory training before tool activation
- **Data Protection:** Leverages existing Google Workspace security controls
- **Usage Monitoring:** Admin visibility into AI tool usage patterns
- **Access Management:** Organizational unit-based control system

### Governance Structure
- **Policy Framework:** Clear guidelines for appropriate use
- **Incident Response:** Clear escalation path for AI-related issues
- **Regular Review:** Quarterly compliance assessments
- **Continuous Improvement:** Policy updates based on usage patterns

## Implementation Timeline

- **Savings:** Potential reduction in shadow IT tool subscriptions
- **Investment:** Training development and initial setup time

### Staff Requirements
- **Initial Setup:** Training development (40 hours), policy documentation (20 hours)
- **Ongoing Administration:** 2 hours/week for monitoring and support
- **Training Delivery:** Utilize existing LMS infrastructure

### Technology Infrastructure
- **Platform:** Utilizes existing Google Workspace infrastructure
- **Monitoring:** Built-in admin tools, no additional software needed
- **Support:** Integration with existing IT helpdesk processes

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks
- **User Resistance:** Mitigated through comprehensive training and clear benefits
- **Technical Issues:** Low risk due to existing Google Workspace familiarity
- **Policy Violations:** Addressed through monitoring and progressive discipline

### Ongoing Risks
- **Tool Proliferation:** Managed through formal request process
- **Data Misuse:** Minimized through training and technical controls
- **Compliance:** Regular audits and policy updates

## Success Metrics

### Usage Metrics
- 90% of staff complete training within 60 days
- 75% adoption rate within 6 months
- <5% policy violation rate

### Business Impact
- Measurable productivity improvements in pilot departments
- Reduction in unauthorized tool usage
- Positive staff feedback on AI capabilities

### Risk Reduction
- Decrease in AI-related security incidents
- Improved audit findings on technology governance
- Enhanced compliance with data protection requirements

## Recommendation

**Approve the revised AI policy to modernize CEO's approach to AI governance, reduce organizational risk, and capture productivity benefits while maintaining appropriate security controls.**

This initiative positions CEO as a leader in responsible AI adoption within the nonprofit sector while delivering measurable business value and risk reduction.
